Computer vision code written in c++ using the OpenCV library

Hello!

I am a current high school senior just learning a bit about computer vision. I started implementing computer vision algorithms such as Canny Edge Detection from scratch, and am now learning about how to do even more with computer vision using the OpenCV library! Feel free to explore my work!
